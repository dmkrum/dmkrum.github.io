David earned a BS in Engineering and Applied Science from the California Institute of Technology and an MS in Computer Science from University of Alabama in Huntsville. His PhD, from the Georgia Institute of Technology, focused on how wearable computers, combined with 3D visualizations could help spatial cognition, that is, help individuals more quickly learn the structure of their surrounding environment. His dissertation involved an eyeglass mounted wearable computer display, a decade before the introduction of Google Glass.
